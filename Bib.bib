              Dictyostelium discoideum
              grows in the soil as a population of independent, uninucleate amoebae. Upon entrance to the stationary phase, the amoebae collect in multicellular aggregates to form organized fruiting bodies composed of spores and stalk cells. Depending upon environmental conditions, the developing aggregate either constructs the fruiting body at the site of aggregation or transforms into a structure that can migrate to a more favorable location. Environmental conditions that favor migration are (i) the accumulation of metabolite(s) produced by the aggregate and (ii) a low ionic strength in the substratum. Conditions that prevent migration or that stop a migrating slug are (i) the presence of buffer and (ii) illumination by overhead light.},
